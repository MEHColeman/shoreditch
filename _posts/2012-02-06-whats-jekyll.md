[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

>Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with beautiful themes such as *Shoreditch*, [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), or [Flexible Jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll).
You can also visit [Jekyll Themes COM](https://jekyll-themes.com/free/) or [Jekyll Themes IO](https://jekyllthemes.io/) for other themes.

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) or [jekyll rb](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more documentation.
